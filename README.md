**Convolutional Neural Networks**

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that focus on data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training/testing for a machine learning pipeline. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other classifiers to analyze and classify data, such as light curves for supernova classification.
